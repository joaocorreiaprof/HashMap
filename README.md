# HashMap Project

This project implements a simple HashMap data structure in JavaScript. A HashMap is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique. The HashMap uses a hashing function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## Features

- Insertion: Add key-value pairs to the HashMap. If the key already exists, the value is updated.
- Retrieval: Retrieve the value associated with a given key
- Deletion: Remove a key-value pair from the HashMap.
- Existence Check: Check if a key exists in the HashMap.
- Resizing: Dynamically resize the internal storage to maintain efficient operations as the number of key-value pairs grows.
- Collision Handling: Efficiently handle collisions using separate chaining.
